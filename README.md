# Drupalcon Denver 2012 - [Hekyll](https://github.com/bmcmurray/hekyll) Theme #

A starter theme for Drupalcon Denver 2012 presentations for use with Hekyll.

Slide sizes are optimized for display at 1024x768 (which is what I'm assuming the conference projectors will be) or higher.

Present using Chrome in Presenter Mode, or Safari in Fullscreen (if you have Mac OS 10.7).

Note: The webfont used on [denver2012.drupal.org](http://denver2012.drupal.org) is not free, so I have picked a similar font as an alternative: [OSP DIN](www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/osp-din).

## To Use: ##

1. Install and configure Hekyll
2. Download this starter theme. Place the `drupalcon` directory from the `CSS` directory into the `themes` directory in your Hekyll's `css` directory.
3. In your Hekyll `_config.yml` file, set the theme to `drupalcon`.
4. Copy the two Markdown from the `slides` directory to your Hekyll `_posts` directory -- These are the Drupalcon primer slide and the title slide for your sesion.
5. Edit `0001-1-2-session-title.md` and update it with your session title and name.
