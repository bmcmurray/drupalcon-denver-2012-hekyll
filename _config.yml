## Hekyll Configuration ##
theme: "drupalcon" # add the name of a theme. Your theme's name should also be the name of the css file. (e.g. "hekyll" will be /css/themes/hekyll/hekyll.css).

  y: 1000  # integer -- set this to the center y point of the overview slide, usually the center of your slide canvas area
  scale: 10  # integer -- set the scale of the overview slide, usually far enough back to fit everything in view
